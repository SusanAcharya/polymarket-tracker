Perfect — this is **exactly** how you should talk to Cursor 👍
I’ll give you a **clear, structured prompt / design document** you can paste directly into Cursor so it can generate the app end-to-end.

This is **Option B: Simple Web App**, fully automated **price tracking + alerts** (NOT auto-selling, which is unsafe).

You can copy **everything below** and paste it into Cursor as one prompt.

# 📄 Cursor Prompt — Polymarket Auto Price Alert Web App

## Goal

Build a **simple personal web app** that automatically tracks Polymarket market prices and sends alerts when predefined price or PnL thresholds are hit, so I don’t need to manually check Polymarket all the time.

This app is **for personal use only**, free-tier friendly, and does **NOT** execute trades or access wallets.

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Market Tracking

* Track multiple Polymarket markets
* Each tracked item should include:

  * Market ID or market URL
  * Outcome (YES / NO / specific option if multi-outcome)
  * Entry price
  * Quantity (shares)
  * Take-profit price
  * Stop-loss price

---

### 2. Automatic Price Fetching

* Fetch live prices from **Polymarket public API**
* Poll prices every **5–15 minutes**
* Store latest price locally (in memory or simple storage)

---

### 3. Alert System (Fully Automated)

* When price **≥ take-profit**, send alert
* When price **≤ stop-loss**, send alert
* Optional:

  * Alert on % PnL (e.g., +40%, −25%)

Alerts should be sent via:

* Email (mandatory)
* Optional: Telegram bot (nice to have)

---

### 4. Dashboard UI

Simple, clean UI showing:

* List of tracked markets
* Current price
* Entry price
* Unrealized PnL (% and $)
* Status:

  * 🟢 Normal
  * 🟡 Near target
  * 🔴 Alert triggered

User should be able to:

* Add a new market
* Edit thresholds
* Remove a market

---

## Automation Requirements

* Price polling must run automatically
* Alerts must trigger **without manual action**
* No need for user to be logged in continuously
* No cron job requiring paid infrastructure

---

## Tech Stack (Free Only)

### Frontend

* Next.js (React)
* Simple Tailwind or basic CSS
* Deployed on **Vercel (free)**

### Backend / Logic

* Serverless API routes in Next.js
* In-memory storage or simple JSON (no paid DB)
* Scheduled polling using:

  * Vercel cron (if available) OR
  * Client-side polling + background tab

### Alerts

* Email via:

  * EmailJS OR
  * Resend free tier OR
  * Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP

(Optional)

* Telegram Bot API (free)

---

## Important Constraints (DO NOT VIOLATE)

* ❌ Do NOT connect wallets
* ❌ Do NOT place trades
* ❌ Do NOT sign transactions
* ❌ Do NOT automate buying/selling

This app is **alerts only**, not a trading bot.

---

## Polymarket-Specific Logic

* Use Polymarket public endpoints
* Handle:

  * YES / NO markets
  * Multi-outcome markets (3+ outcomes)
* Market prices are in **USD between 0 and 1**
* Resolution logic is NOT needed

---

## UX Expectations

* Very minimal
* Built for one user
* No authentication required (or simple local-only setup)
* Works on desktop and mobile
* Clear visual PnL feedback

---

## Bonus Features (Optional)

If time permits:

* Global settings:

  * Default profit %
  * Default stop %
* Sound alert toggle
* Dark mode
* Export/import tracked markets as JSON

---

## Output Expectations

Cursor should:

1. Generate the full project structure
2. Implement API price fetching
3. Implement alert logic
4. Build basic dashboard UI
5. Provide instructions to deploy on Vercel

---

## Success Criteria

* I can add a Polymarket market
* I stop checking Polymarket manually
* I receive alerts when price hits my targets
* App runs fully on free tiers

---

### Final Instruction to Cursor

> Build this as a **clean MVP**, prioritize correctness and simplicity over polish.
> Assume this is for a technically curious user, not production scale.

---

## 🔥 Important Reality Check (so you’re aligned)

Even with “full automation”:

* You still **manually sell** on Polymarket
* This is intentional and safer
* This is how real traders actually operate

---

If you want next:

* I can **simplify this further** for Cursor (even more direct)
* Or help you **review Cursor’s output**
* Or turn this into a **Telegram-only bot** instead

Just tell me what you want to do next.
